# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using_Deep_Learning
This project implements a deep learning model for the automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI images. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as tumor or non-tumor, aiming to support early diagnosis and improve treatment planning.
